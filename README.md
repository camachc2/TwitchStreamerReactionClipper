# TwitchStreamerReactionClipper
 Program that takes screenshots of kills on the game of Apex Legends, extracts the name, runs the name through a database of usernames, and clips the streamer on Twitch.tv if they are live. I send the screenshot to an image-to-text API to extract the name and I use my own Twitch API wrapper to clip the reaction in real time.
